# Half Saturation Concentrations (Monod model)
# grouped by microbial species
# listed substrates are required, i.e. if their concentration should drop to zero, growth stops.
# however, some substrates may be non-limiting, in which case their half-saturation concentration is set to zero.
# (or the half-saturation concentration is simply not known, so we ignore the associated Monod factor)
